            <p>A goal in putting this together is for the HTML to be very simple and descriptive. This is the skeleton of what you need:</p>




            <p>I then set up a media query to handle the header and navigation at mobile resolutions. When setting up your mobile navigation, it's

                important to be thoughtful about which devices you include. I don't believe in serving mobile navigation (or mobile sites) to iPad

                users. Since the release of the device, users have expected the ability to navigate "full" websites. Directly clicking menu items is

                preferable to opening a menu and then clicking an item when space allows it. The next important cutoff are 7" Android tablets which

                generally fall at 600px. I try to serve these desktop sites whenever possible as well.</p>
            <p>To set up the mobile navigation, I first code it as if it had already been opened. I then worry about toggling its state later. To

                illustrate this, I put the "transition" code separately at the bottom.:</p>

            <p>A nice feature of having the click event on the entire #nav block instead of just the button is that when you click a link, the nav

                will close while the next page loads, making it seem more fluid.</p>
